# DataCollection
Collecting data using many of Arduino friendly sensors, such as DHT11 to measure humidity and temperature and the photoresistor to measure light energy

  * Pratical Engineering's video is amazing if you'd like to create your own Arduino controlled garden.
    Gave me curiousity of how to use the DHT11, photoresistors, and other environmental sensors.
